/**
 * This module is used to define rules for user email (which is also the unique username)
 * and to test emails against these rules.
 *
 * Email must be a UWaterloo email. These rules do not guarantee an email is a valid UWaterloo email address.
 * They only help to filter out some that are surely invalid.
 * Rules:
 *      - Must end with @uwaterloo.ca (.edu.uwaterloo.ca is not allowed to avoid duplication)
 *      - The part before @uwaterloo.ca must be at least 6 character and at most 12 letters/numbers
 *      - Only lowercase letters or numbers are allowed before @uwaterloo.ca
